# Hello-World
Floating around

Greetings beautiful beings

Just trying to give myself a hobby. Single mom of 2 
gets bored sometimes.

We love all creatures. Depression and anxiety is a 
sticky business over here. Fight to survive because
in the end we really are all loved more than we know.

MentalHeathAwarness.
